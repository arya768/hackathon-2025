🤖 Hackathon 2025: Interchangeable Data Collecting Robot<br>
A modular robot designed for collecting real world data in both healthcare and environmental applications.<br>
Built with accessibility and adaptability in mind, this robot uses affordable components and a flexible design to serve multiple use cases.<br>
🌍 Core Objectives<br>
📊 Measure the environmental impact of humans and animals<br>
e.g., how population density affects air quality.<br>
🧬 Analyze how environmental changes affect humans and animals<br>
e.g., tracking the effects of building a factory near a populated or wildlife-heavy area.<br>
🧠 Future Functionality<br>
🩺 Can be advanced to gather more specific medical data for targeted population groups.<br>
🌋 Can be adapted for extreme environmental monitoring, such as:<br>
The middle of the ocean<br>
Near active volcanoes<br>
Remote wilderness zones<br>
